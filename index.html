        <p>We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this... I'm sure. Ugh! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. Chewie? Chewie, is that you? Ah! Chew--Chewie! Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on? Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody. A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur. I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. I must speak with Jabba. You will take me to Jabba now! You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? No... of course not. I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm? Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. Then I am a Jedi? Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
